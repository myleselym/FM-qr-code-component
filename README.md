## My process
I really just plowed head first into this one. I will take the time to configure my css file with global variables next time to be more efficient while trying to adhere to the style guide.
### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
### What I learned

I learned how to leverage margin, padding, and min and max width to create a responsive design. 
### Continued development

This project showed me that you can do a lot with just CSS and HTML. I look forward to continuing to find elegant solutions to the next challenges.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank the Mr Coder youtube channel (@MrCoderYt) for some new ideas on how to leverage margin, padding, and min and max width to create this responsive design. Normally I would use flex or grid but he offered some elegant and simple solutions. I can over think things when I code, I appreciate his straight forward approach to css.
